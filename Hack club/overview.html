        Mount Everest, the highest mountain peak in the world (8,848.86m 
        above the sea level), is located in Nepal. Mountaineering and other 
        types of adventure tourism and ecotourism are important attractions 
        for visitors. The World Heritage Site Lumbini, birthplace of Buddha, 
        is located in the south of the West region of Nepal (which despite 
        the name is located in the center of the country) and there are 
        other important religious pilgrimage sites throughout the country.

        the country in 2019 as compared to 1,173,072 in 2018. The 
        government of Nepal declared 2011 to be Nepal Tourism Year, and 
        hoped to attract one million foreign tourists to the country during 
        that year. The government of Nepal has also declared Lumbini 
        Tourism Year 2012 to promote Lumbini. The government of Nepal has 
        also recently declared Visit Nepal 2020 with the aim of bringing in
